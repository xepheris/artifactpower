ARTIFACTPOWER.INFO SOURCE CODE COMMENTARY


REQUIREMENTS:
- PHP5
- MYSQL

SQL contains all necessary tables, although `data1` itself is empty.

You need to configure /modules/serv.php to your likes.

In case you use parts of /modules/api.php please attribute credit to artifactpower.info or reddit.com/user/xepher1s.


TO DO:

- somehow automatically update all entries in a realistic timespan (atm 1 update/sec)
- visual redesign (maybe; canâ€™t do that alone)
